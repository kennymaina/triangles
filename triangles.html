    <strong><h2>Types of triangles based on sides</h2></strong>
       equilateral
  <p> A triangle having all the three sides of equal length is an equilateral triangle.
Since all sides are equal, all angles are equal too</p>

<strong><h3>Isosceles triangle</h3></strong>
A triangle having two sides of equal length is an Isosceles triangle.
The two angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.

  <strong><h5>architectural triangles</h5></strong>
  <p>The two most common triangular forms used in architecture are equilateral and isosceles.
  Triangles are effective tools for architecture and are used in the design of buildings and other structures as they provide strength and stability.
  This is why many residential homes have A-frames; it provides a sturdy structure.</p>
